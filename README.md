# classifier_performance

In this assignment I am training different classifiers and evaluating with certain metrics. 

* decision tree with gini measure : max_depth = [5,10,15,20,25]
* decision tree with entropy measure: max_depth = [5,10,15,20,25] 
* baseline KNN with neighbors = 5, and other measurements
* baseline RF with n_estimators (trees) = 100

# How to run this code
1. Run **classifier_performance.ipynb** which has every classifier running.
2. Please read report for visualization of performance and other details.
