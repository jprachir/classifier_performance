# classifier_performance

In this assignment we are training different classifiers and evaluating with certain metrics. 

* decision tree with gini measure : max_depth = [5,10,15,20,25]
* decision tree with entropy measure: max_depth = [5,10,15,20,25] 
* baseline KNN with neighbors = 5, and other measurements
* baseline RF with n_estimators (trees) = 100
